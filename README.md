# retailwhiskeystore
In this project, we'll walk throught the creation of a data architect for a whiskey retail store that enables the shop managers to make better desicions.
I'll start with ETL process to get whiskey data into the company's central database. 
The data is extracted via https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com via python using webscrapping.
Data will be stored in the central database. Then, I will design a data warehouse that extract data from central database and 
provide a single source of relevant data for various departaments.
At the end, I'll create various visualizations that will assist in quick desicions making.
